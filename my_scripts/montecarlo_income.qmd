Resource 2: https://evalsp21.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/random-numbers/

  + specifically income dist

Variables:

+ Gender
+ Age
+ wage in sek
+

How can we create a realistic wage distribution?

+ age span?
+ mean age?
+ 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

fake_people <- tibble(
  income = rnorm(1000, mean = 40000, sd = 15000), 
  age = rtruncnorm(1000, mean = 35, sd = 5, a = 12, b = 65),
  # add gender her
  education = rnorm(1000, mean = 16, sd = 4))
```
