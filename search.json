You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username).\nFirst, choose an existing website to copy. The simplest option is to start with this site: quarto-website-tutorial.\nOther options of potential interest:\n\n2021-Cloud-Hackathon\n2022-SWOT-Ocean-Cloud-Workshop\nOpenscapes Approach-Guide\n\nNext, follow these steps to fork and setup your repo with GitHub Actions from Gavin Fay, using the repo you chose. These instructions will take ~5 minutes.\nNow you’ve got a copy of your repo of choice in your own GitHub account, and you’re set to start making your own edits. Your GitHub repo is set up with a GitHub Action that will use Quarto to rebuild and republish your site anytime you make a commit: committing will trigger the GitHub Action to rebuild and republish the book.\nNote that the GitHub Action for this book does not include R or Python so those will need to be added if your website relies on code. See https://github.com/r-lib/actions for more details and examples.\n\nDownload instead of fork\nForking might not always be the way to go - you can’t fork into the same GitHub user account or organization so if for example you want to make a copy of 2021-Cloud-Hackathon repo within the same NASA-Openscapes GitHub Organization, you’ll need to download instead of fork. In this case, follow these steps to download and copy into a new repository, and set up the GitHub Action and the gh-pages branch for publishing, separately.\n\nDownload github repo files\nNavigate to https://github.com/openscapes/quarto-website-tutorial (or any other quarto site repo of choice). Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP”. When it downloads on your computer, unzip the files.\n\n\nCreate a new GitHub repo\nNavigate to your GitHub account or organization, and create a new repository, naming it what you’d like. You’ll need a free GitHub account that you create at github.com (follow this advice about choosing your username). When you’re logged in, github.com will show a green button that says “New” which you’ll also see as you navigate to your username’s repository page.\n\n\nAdd original site files\nIf you’re comfortable cloning the new repository and copying files into it locally before committing and pushing back to GitHub, that is preferable to the GitHub file uploader, which does have limitations with complex repos. The uploader does not allow upload of folders, so some manual work would be required.\nTo use the GitHub file uploader, click the button next to the green “Code” button that says “Add file”. Add file &gt; Upload files. Then, on your computer, select all the files in unzipped folder (command-A or control-A), and drag them to the GitHub uploader page. Scroll down to write a commit message, which effectively saves your files when you’re working in the browser."

We’ll do this in a few steps: we’ll set up a GitHub Action within your repo, and create a gh-pages branch.\nFirst, the GitHub Action. Go back to your main view of your GitHub repository by clicking on the name of your repository at the top-left (the url in your browser window should say https://github.com/username/repo-name).\nNext to the green code button, click Add file &gt; Create new file. Name it exactly this: .github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml . In detail: start by typing the . with github and when you type the / it will give you a new text box to type workflows (plural!), then another /, and finally, quarto-publish.yml.\nNow you’ll have an empty new file. Paste the following in this empty file - you can click on the top-right of this box to copy all the code inside this code box:\non:\n  push:\n    branches: main\n\nname: Render and Publish\n\njobs:\n  build-deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Check out repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2 \n        \n      - name: Set up Quarto\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n        with:\n          # To install LaTeX to build PDF book \n          tinytex: true \n          # uncomment below and fill to pin a version\n          # version: 0.9.600\n      \n      # add software dependencies here\n\n      - name: Publish to GitHub Pages (and render)\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this secret is always available for github actions\nCommit this to save your new quarto-publish.yml file. This is your GitHub Action.\nFinally, from your main repo page, click Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General. Under ‘Workflow permissions’, select ‘Read and write permissions’. Save.\nNext, we’ll create a new gh-pages branch. Go back to the main view of your GitHub repository. On the far left from the green “Code” button, click the button that says “main”. In the pull-down menu, type gh-pages - all lowercase, with a hyphen. Click the bold text that says “Create branch: gh-pages from main”.\nNow click on the Settings tab in the top right of your repository. On the left sidebar, click Pages. At the top of Pages under “Source”, select gh-pages root, and press Save (may already be saved by default).\nTo view your published website, at your main repository page, on the right side, click the gear-icon, select ‘Use your GitHub Pages website’."
