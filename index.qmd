## Test text {#welcome}

This is a link: [Quarto](https://quarto.org).


## Qs

I wonder what controls the arrows at the bottom of this page. Probably in the yml.


The _site folder contains the html-files:

+ index.html

+ learning-more.html

+ transition-from-rmarkdown.html

I think Index is the 1st link on the LHS and the other two are the last two links. Where is Explore and setup and Quarto workflows from?

A: I found a index.qmd that contains the text in "Quarto workflows" in the quarto-workflows folder.
